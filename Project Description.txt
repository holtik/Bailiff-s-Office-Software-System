This is a Software modeling project where we have to model a software or a system and make it a semi-finished product able to be sold to a business.
For this project, we have chosen to create a system for an enforcement office. An enforcement office is a place that deals with enforcing of court decisions,
debt or interest payments, bussiness advices, legal counceling etc. The purpose of this system is to make the job of enforcing the uppermentioned items easier for the 
workers of the office and let them see in a more structured manner all the information that passes through the studio to make the work process more efficient.
